# The Fractional Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that can be solved using a greedy approach. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack problem, where items can only be taken fully or left behind, in the fractional knapsack problem, items can be divided into fractions, allowing us to take parts of an item to maximize the total value.

# Problem Description
# Given:
# A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity.
# A set of items, each with a specific weight and value.

# Objective:

# Maximize the total value in the knapsack by selecting items (or fractions of items) to fill the knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity.
# Greedy Strategy
# Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item.
# Sort items in descending order based on this ratio.
# Pick items in order of highest ratio until the knapsack is full. If an item can't be fully added due to weight constraints, take the fraction that fits.

# Example
# Letâ€™s say we have a knapsack capacity of 50 and the following items:

# Item	Weight	Value	Value/Weight
# 1	    10	    60	    6
# 2	    20	    100	    5
# 3	    30	    120	    4
# The greedy strategy would select items by their highest value-to-weight ratio first.



# Class to represent an item with weight and value
class Item:
    def __init__(self, weight, value):
        self.weight = weight
        self.value = value
    
    # Method to calculate value-to-weight ratio
    def value_per_weight(self):
        return self.value / self.weight
